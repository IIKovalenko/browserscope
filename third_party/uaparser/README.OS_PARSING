OS parsing functionality has been added. This has required certain changes to user_agent_parser's interface.

RELEVANT CHANGES:

There are now multiple parsing methods in the user_agent_parser module.

The old Parse method is still present for backwards compatibility.

The new methods to be used are, as appropriate: ParseAll, ParseOS, ParseUserAgent, and ParseDevice.

Note that ParseDevice is currently incomplete.

ParseUserAgent is named as such due to the possibility of adding a ParseBrowser method in the future, which could more correctly (more strictly) identify only browsers (e.g. iPhone not parsed as a browser as it currently is).

The old Parse method returned a tuple of the parsed bits. The new Parse* methods return flat dictionaries of the parsed bits.

Javascript override bits must be (optional) keyworded arguments in the new Parse* methods.

There are now multiple pretty printing methods. Pretty is left for backwards compatibility.

Pretty* can be used with each corresponding Parse* such that the result of Parse* is just "double asterixed" into Pretty* e.g. PrettyOS(**os_result)

ok great bye :)
